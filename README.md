The setup was created from scratch using Andrew Farmer's build-your-own-startup [tutorial](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/#0-intro). Apart from the official docs of the tools mentioned, Brad Westfall's [blog posts](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-router/) were very helpful. The folder structure was inspired by the popular [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit), although their code wasn't used.
